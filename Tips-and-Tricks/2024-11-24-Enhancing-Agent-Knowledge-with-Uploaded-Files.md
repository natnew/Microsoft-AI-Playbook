# Enhancing Agent Knowledge with Uploaded Files

**Tip**: Expand your Copilot agent's knowledge base by uploading relevant documents directly into Copilot Studio. This allows the agent to reference specific information during interactions. To upload files:

1. In your agent's **Knowledge** section, select **Add knowledge**.
2. Choose **Upload files** and select the documents to include.
3. Provide a clear description for each file to guide the agent's use of the information.

This method is ideal for incorporating proprietary data or detailed resources into your agent's responses.
