# Creating and Sharing Agents in SharePoint

**Tip**: Enhance your SharePoint site by creating custom agents tailored to your team's needs. With edit permissions, you can build an agent that accesses specific sites, pages, and files, providing focused assistance. To create and share an agent:

1. Navigate to your SharePoint site.
2. Click the **Copilot** icon in the top ribbon.
3. Select **Create an agent** and follow the prompts to customize its knowledge sources and behavior.
4. After creation, share the agent by selecting the ellipsis (...) next to its name and choosing **Share**.

This allows your team to interact with the agent directly within SharePoint or via Teams chat, streamlining collaboration.
