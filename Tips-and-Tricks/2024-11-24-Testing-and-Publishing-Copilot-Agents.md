# Testing and Publishing Copilot Agents

**Tip**: Before deploying your Copilot agent, thoroughly test its functionality within Copilot Studio. Utilize the built-in testing environment to simulate user interactions and refine responses. Once satisfied:

1. Click **Create** to finalize the agent.
2. Select **Go to agent** to initiate a new chat with the agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot.
3. Use the right rail in Microsoft Copilot to access and manage your agents.

Regular testing ensures your agent performs as intended, providing a seamless user experience.
