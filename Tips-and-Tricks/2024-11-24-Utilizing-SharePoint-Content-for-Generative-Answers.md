# Utilizing SharePoint Content for Generative Answers

**Tip**: To enable your Copilot agent to generate answers based on SharePoint content, configure the necessary permissions and settings. Ensure the agent has **Sites.Read.All** and **Files.Read.All** permissions to access the content. This setup allows the agent to provide informed responses grounded in your organization's SharePoint data.
