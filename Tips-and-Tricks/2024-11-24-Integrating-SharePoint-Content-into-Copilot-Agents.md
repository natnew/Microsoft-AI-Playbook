# Integrating SharePoint Content into Copilot Agents

**Tip**: Enhance your Copilot agents by connecting them to SharePoint as a knowledge source. This allows agents to access and utilize content from specified SharePoint sites, improving the relevance and accuracy of responses. To add SharePoint as a knowledge source:

1. Open your agent in Copilot Studio.
2. Navigate to the **Knowledge** section.
3. Select **Add knowledge** and choose **SharePoint**.
4. Enter the SharePoint URL you wish to connect.

Ensure the agent has the necessary permissions to access the specified SharePoint content.
