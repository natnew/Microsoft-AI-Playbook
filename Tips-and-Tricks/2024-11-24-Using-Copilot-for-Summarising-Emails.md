# Using Copilot for Summarising Emails

**Tip**: Struggling to manage long email threads? Microsoft Copilot in Outlook can quickly summarise email conversations into clear bullet points, saving you time and keeping you organised. Simply ask Copilot:  
*"Summarise this thread into the main points and action items."*

This is perfect for catching up on missed conversations or distilling complex discussions into actionable takeaways.
