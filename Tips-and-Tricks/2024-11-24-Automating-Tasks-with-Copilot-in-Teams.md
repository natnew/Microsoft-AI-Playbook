# Automating Tasks with Copilot in Teams

**Tip**: Make your meetings more productive with Microsoft Copilot in Teams. Ask Copilot to summarise meeting discussions, create follow-up tasks, and even draft action items. Try asking:  
*"What were the key points from todayâ€™s meeting, and what actions need to be taken?"*

This ensures nothing gets missed and everyone stays on the same page.
