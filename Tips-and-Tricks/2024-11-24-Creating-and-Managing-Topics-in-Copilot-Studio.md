**Tip**: Topics define how conversations flow in your agent. To create a topic:

1. In Copilot Studio, go to the **Topics** page.
2. Click **+ New topic**.
3. Provide a name and trigger phrases for the topic.
4. Use the authoring canvas to define the conversation path.

Organizing topics effectively ensures your agent can handle diverse user interactions smoothly.
