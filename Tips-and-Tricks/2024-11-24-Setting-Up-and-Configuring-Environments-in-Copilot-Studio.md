# Setting Up and Configuring Environments in Copilot Studio

**Tip**: Proper environment configuration in Copilot Studio is crucial for agent development and deployment. To set up an environment:

1. Access the **Power Platform admin center**.
2. Create a new environment or select an existing one.
3. Assign the **Agent Author** security role to yourself to gain necessary permissions.
4. In Copilot Studio, select the environment to start building agents.

This setup ensures a structured and secure workspace for your agent development.
