# Utilizing Entities in Copilot Studio

**Tip**: Entities in Copilot Studio help your agent recognize and extract specific information from user inputs. To create an entity:

1. Open your agent in Copilot Studio.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Entities**.
3. Click **Add an entity** and choose between **Closed list** or **Regular expression** types.
4. Define the entity's values or patterns.

Incorporating entities enables your agent to handle user inputs more effectively by identifying key information.
