## ðŸ”¬ **1. Custom AI Models**

### **Azure Machine Learning**
- **Train a Custom Model**:
  1. Upload your dataset to Azure Machine Learning.
  2. Use AutoML for automated model training.
  3. Deploy the trained model as a web service.

- **Example Use Case**: Predict customer churn based on historical data using custom classification models.

### **Custom Vision**
- **Build an Image Classification Model**:
  1. Collect and label images in Custom Vision.
  2. Train the model using Azure Cognitive Services.
  3. Deploy the model for use in applications or workflows.

## ðŸ“Š **2. Scaling AI Workloads**

### **Distributed Training with Azure**
- Use **Azure Batch** to train large models across multiple nodes efficiently.
- Optimize costs by using **Spot VMs** and pre-emptible compute instances.

### **Hybrid AI Architectures**
- Combine Azure AI with open-source frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Example Workflow:
  ```python
  from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

  # Connect to Azure workspace
  ws = Workspace.from_config()

  # Load dataset
  dataset = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, 'training_data')

  # Continue training process with TensorFlow or PyTorch
  # Add your custom model training code here
