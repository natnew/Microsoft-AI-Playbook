# Fun Fact Fridays: Hybrid Bonding – Saving Moore’s Law!

**Date**: September 13, 2023  

### Did You Know?  
Chipmakers are pushing the limits of technology with **hybrid bonding**, a revolutionary process that stacks two or more chips together. This 3D stacking allows for millions of connections per square millimeter, creating ultra-dense chip designs.

### Why This Matters:
Hybrid bonding could extend Moore’s Law by creating tighter connections between chip layers. This reduces power consumption, boosts processing speed, and helps technologies like AI run faster and more efficiently. The future of semiconductors just got a boost!
